<p>Once there was a tree....<br>
    and she loved a little boy.<br>
    And everyday the boy would come<br>
    and he would gather her leaves<br>
    and make them into crowns<br>
    and play king of the forest.<br>
    He would climb up her trunk<br>
    and swing from her branches<br>
    and eat apples.<br>
    And they would play hide-and-go-seek.<br>
    And when he was tired,<br>
    he would sleep in her shade.<br>
    And the boy loved the tree....<br>
    very much.<br>
    And the tree was happy.</p>
